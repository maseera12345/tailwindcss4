    links, and the ad-free feature completely for free!
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">What is SFlix?</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    SFlix is a newly-created site that allows users to watch and download movies 
    and TV shows online in HD quality for free. SFlix’s purpose is to become a free 
    alternative to Netflix so movie enthusiasts can enjoy all the features that the 
    giant streaming service offers without having to pay a dime. SFlix is created in 
    order for movie fans to watch movies safely and seamlessly no matter what their 
    financial situation is. We might have a long way to go to reach our goal, but we 
    believe, with your support, it can be achieved soon.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Is SFlix or 123Movies Better for streaming movies and shows?</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    123Movies is no doubt the most popular free movie site ever. At peak, 123movies 
    welcomed 98 million users a month. To many movie fans, whenever they think of free 
    movie streaming, the domain 123movies.to pops up. Unfortunately, the site was shut 
    down in 2018 and since then, we haven’t heard any official news about a comeback 
    from the team. In fact, multiple sites have been created to copy 123movies and 
    they might be ill-intentioned. Visiting such sites might cause you troubles because 
    they are all filled with malicious ads. For your complete security, you should stay 
    with SFlix instead. Hackers have no chances to access your device or gain your 
    private information on SFlix as we are free from ads and do not require any registration.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Is It Illegal to Use SFlix?</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    We are currently accessible all over the world. SFlix is not technically a legal 
    site, however, using SFlix for free online movie streaming is not illegal. According 
    to copyright attorneys, you will only be convicted for a jail term or subject to 
    criminal or civil charges when you share or download pirated content. If you insist 
    on downloading videos to watch offline later, use a reliable VPN and proceed at your own risk.
  </p>

  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Is SFlix safe?</h2>
  <p className="mb-4">
    SFlix is a new site so it is understandable if our security is questioned. There 
    has not been much feedback about the site’s safety for references, but you should 
    not be worried about your safety here. SFlix is ad-free; therefore, you are safe 
    from viruses, trojans, malware, and other malicious computer programs. SFlix does 
    not require you to reveal any private information for a signup; therefore, you are

    you do not need to use a VPN, anti-virus program, and ADBlock extension while 
    binge-watching movies and TV shows on SFlix. Your movie night should be spent 
    without any worries. And with these features, we are confident that it will be 
    the best movie night you have ever had.
